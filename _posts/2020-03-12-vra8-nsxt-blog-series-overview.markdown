With the recent release of vRA 8.0, I have been receiving many questions from customers about how vRA 8 can leverage NSX-T. 

This blog series will focus on demonstrating how you can create vRA 8 blueprints that utilize NSX-T constructs. 

Here is a list of blogs that I am planning on creating for this series (as of March 12, 2020):
* Part 1: vRA 8 Blueprint + Existing NSX-T Networks
* Part 2: vRA 8 Blueprint + On-demand Routed NSX-T Networks
* Part 3: vRA 8 Blueprint + Existing Security Groups (Method 1)
* Part 4: vRA 8 Blueprint + Existing Security Groups (Method 2)
* Part 5: vRA 8 Blueprint + On-demand Security Groups
* Part 6: vRA 8 Blueprint + On-demand NSX-T Load Balancer
* Part 7: vRA 8 Blueprint + On-demand NAT NSX-T Networks

The list of blogs is subject to change.
